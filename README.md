# TriviaGame

For this project, I created a trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out. If the player selects the correct answer, a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option appears. After a few seconds, the next question is displayed.

The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

If the player runs out of time, the player is told that time's up and the correct answer is displayed. After a few seconds, the next question appears. If the player chooses the wrong answer, the player is alerted they selected the wrong option and then the correct answer is displayed. After a few seconds, the the next question appears.

On the final screen, you will see the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
